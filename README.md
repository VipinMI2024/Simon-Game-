Simon Game

Overview
The Simon Game is a front-end web application that recreates the classic Simon electronic memory game. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project challenges players to repeat an increasingly complex sequence of colored button presses. The game features a responsive interface and interactive gameplay, serving as a practice project to demonstrate web development skills in creating dynamic, user-engaging applications.
Features

Interactive Gameplay: Players repeat sequences of colored buttons (typically red, green, blue, yellow) that increase in length.
Visual Feedback: Button animations and color changes enhance user interaction.
Sound Effects: (Assumed, based on typical Simon implementations) Audio cues for each button press.
Score Tracking: Displays the player's current level or sequence length.
Responsive Design: Styled with CSS for a clean, user-friendly interface across devices.

Installation

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/VipinMI2024/VipinMI2024.git
cd VipinMI2024


Navigate to the Simon Game folder (if organized in a subfolder):
cd Simon-Game

Note: If files are in the root, skip this step. Consider organizing files into a Simon-Game folder for clarity.

Open the project:

No additional dependencies are required since the project uses vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


Run the project:

Open simonGame.html in a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) by double-clicking the file or using a local server:python -m http.server 8000


Navigate to http://localhost:8000/simonGame.html in your browser to play the Simon Game.



Usage

Play the Game: Open simonGame.html in a browser to start the game. Follow the sequence of colored button presses displayed by the game and repeat it correctly to advance to the next level.
Interact: Click or tap the colored buttons to input your sequence. The game provides visual and (assumed) audio feedback.
Customize: Modify simonGame.css for visual changes (e.g., colors, button sizes) or simonGame.js to adjust game mechanics (e.g., sequence speed, difficulty).
Debug: Use browser developer tools (F12) to inspect the JavaScript console for any errors or to test modifications.

Requirements

A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
No additional software or dependencies are needed.

Future Improvements

Add sound effects (if not already included) using HTML5 Audio or external libraries.
Implement difficulty levels (e.g., adjustable sequence speed or pattern complexity).
Enhance responsive design with CSS media queries for better mobile support.
Add high score tracking using localStorage to persist player scores.
Integrate animations (e.g., CSS transitions or GSAP) for smoother button effects.
